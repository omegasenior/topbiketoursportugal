      Porto: Before starting this cycling journey towards Santiago de
      Compostela, it’s almost obligatory to present and know Porto, classified
      as World Heritage and Capital of Culture and Tourism. Join us in a city
      tour (bike or walk) in the City Centre and discover a huge miscellanea of
      heritage, from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 20th Century. Meet
      famous and well-known hot spots, such as the bookstore that influenced
      J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, the magnificent Stock Exchange Marke, blue
      and white tiled churches and much more. Art, heritage and traditions are
      meant to be found and seen during this short city tour.

      Day 2 – Porto - Esposende, From Fold n´Visit’s store, based on the
      “Invicta” city of Porto, we will begin our journey heading to Esposende, a
      seaside city located in the North. During the first day, you will be
      overwhelmed with seaside landscapes and small “Portuguese rivieras” until
      you reach Esposende, a city from the Middle Ages. During your first day, a
      huge variety of fishing villages (Póvoa de Varzim) will be met by us,
      where we can experience ancient traditions linked to the fish exploration
      as well taste this famous gastronomy. In Vila do Conde, you’ll know why
      these Portuguese coastal cities were so important during the “el dorado”
      of the Portuguese Discoveries.

      Day 3 – Esposende – Caminha. We’re reaching to Viana do Castelo, another
      sea docking city also holding a huge importance during the Discoveries.
      During the XIV-XVth Centuries it was in this precise city that the ships
      were developed to be departed to Brasil, India, Africa and other
      Portuguese colonies.  Still, in the district of Viana do Castelo, our
      destination will be Caminha. This city finds the delta of the river Minho,
      being part of the incredible landscape. Caminha is also very well-known
      for its natural and green heritage, like the sightseeing areas,
      waterfalls, beaches and the camping park.

      Day 4 – Caminha – Baiona: During our fourth cycling day, we’re going to
      enter in Spanish territory, ending in Bayona.  It’s a city politically
      linked to Pontevedra where you can breathe the sea breeze. Yet, apart from
      the sea landscape you can also get lost in the old city centre, born from
      Roman roots and grew always towards the coast during the Middle Ages, with
      an influence from the Catholic Church. Curiously, during the XVI Century,
      Bayona was raided by British ships led by the great corsair and explorer
      Francis Drake who saw an opportunity to establish a commercial and
      merchant point in this territory.

      Day 5 – Baiona – Pontevedra: The fifth day will encompass the stream of
      Vigo and will end in San Simon’s bay with a watery landscape to feast our
      eyes.  Always following the coast line, this day will be dedicated to
      Arcade and its famous oysters. Apart from this delightful cuisine, you
      will see monuments and sights dedicated to the Santiago’s culture, such as
      the church of Santiago in Arcade (XII-XIII centuries) and roads or paths
      that will lead to our pilgrimage destination.  It’s almost mandatory that
      if you are passing by Arcade, you must taste and enjoy the famous oysters,
      produced and harvested in the waters of this region. Curiously, during
      April’s first week there’s a festival dedicated to this traditional
      gastronomy – “Fiesta de la Ostra” – where the city is filled with tourists
      and pilgrims to attend this event.

      Day 6 – Pontevedra – Caldas de Reis  Heading to a pre-Roman city, Caldas
      de Reis, a province which belongs to Pontevedra.  According to historical
      archives, the first inhabitants were a pre-Roman community that lived from
      the hot springs of this territory. The name “Caldas de Reis” is connected
      to the birthplace of Afonso VII, acting in the Middle Ages as a pilgrim
      path to Santiago de Compostela. Apart form the rich cultural heritage,
      like Arcade, Caldas de Reis holds a peculiar gastronomy, such as the
      “empanadas” of lamprey and the traditional Spanish bread. Since the hot
      springs accompanied the evolution of this territory, nowadays is a hot
      spot for tourism who seek better healthy treatments for several illnesses.

      Day 7 – Caldas de Reis – Santiago de Compostela  Our last and seventh day
      will meet Santiago de Compostela as the final destination, one of the
      ultimate pilgrimage cores in Western Europe.  Like Rome and Jerusalem, the
      city of Santiago de Compostela present us a unique religious beacon for
      tourists who find in this cycling journey an act of faith and inner-self.
      Reach to the Square of Obradoiro, where you will witness the majestic
      baroque cathedral where the remains of the apostle are located.
