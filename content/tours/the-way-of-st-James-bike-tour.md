Going from Saint Jean Pied de Port, in the Pyrenees, all the way to Santiago de Compostela, the French way is probably the most known route of the St. James Way. Its use goes back to the 9th century when the route only extended from Oviedo to Santiago de Compostela.
Thousands of pilgrims choose this amazing route each year, not only for its authenticity, but also for all the amazing places one finds him/herself in, while on the road.
