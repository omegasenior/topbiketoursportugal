Carmen and Fernando made the Way to Santiago by the Coast in October 2017.

As we explained to all our customers, our way in the first 3 days touches 70% the original route of the coast. We've changed the original coast path so it's easy for most people.

However, this couple from Brazil took the liberty of following the coast path by following the arrows and pedaling through more complicated rails, making this adventure even more unforgettable.

Thanks for the photos Carmen and Fernando
