      isbon: Starting this astonishing trip, the city of Lisbon, Portugal's
      capital. A city that has been influenced by many different far-off
      cultures over time, still maintains a village feel in each historic
      neighborhood.  The wide variety of landscapes and heritage is always close
      by, whether to the north or south of the capital. Fado is an expression of
      what it is to be Portuguese and has also been awarded World Heritage
      status. You can hear it at night in a fado house or in a traditional
      neighborhood.

    description: ' Cycling on this day throughout some Portuguese lovely cities, like the city of Montijo, strongly marked by the river.  Like almost all the localities of the Ribatejo, Montijo has great traditions of the “brava” celebration, being the bulls and the bullfights an essential characteristic of the city parties. Entering Pinhal Novo, that used to be the biggest vineyard in the country, and nowadays, it’s an expanding urban centre, it’s located near the Arrabida Natural Park.  Bike along the dramatic, pine-brushed coastline of Parque Natural da Arrábida, park of great beauty.  To end this rich first day, reachable by ferry the pristine setting of the Tróia Peninsula, unquestionably one of Portugal''s best-kept secrets.  The peninsula''s stands at the tip of a narrow spit of land comprised mostly of white sandy beaches fringed with shifting dunes and emerald pine forests.  Much of the territory is set within the confines of a nature reserve, the Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado, a protected wildlife haven with a wealth of bird-watching possibilities.'

      Beginning the day with some extensive sandy beaches within, Santo André is
      a very multicultural city, which received a lot of people from Portuguese
      former colonies.  The extensive forest that protects Santo André is a good
      example of possible respect between the protection of the environment and
      the industrial development.  Cycling now in Comporta, a protected nature
      reserve and one-time fisherman’s village now famous for its paradisiacal
      looking beaches of great quality and mild weather during the summer. 
      Finishing the day passing through the village of Melides, which dates back
      to the 19th century, this village emerged as a small clump of fishermen
      and farmers. Its inhabitants are mainly dedicated to the cultivation of
      land and handicraft activities, such as pottery and the making of cork
      stoppers.

      Cycling in direction of Milfontes, the perfect combination of History and
      Nature. Because it was situated on the coast, this region has a history of
      often being besieged by pirates.  Having the opportunity to discover the
      city where Vasco da Gama was born (the Portuguese explorer and first
      European to reach India by sea, connecting the West and the Orient in the
      15th century) you’ll cicle the port city of Sines. Nowadays it’s
      remarkable for receiving 50% of the countries’ exportations.  In the
      village of Porto Covo, where you’ll find “Praia Grande”, one of the most
      sought after by locals and tourists. Spacious and sheltered by the cliff,
      is one of the busiest during the summer.

      Quieter than Vila Nova de Milfontes, Zambujeira do Mar attracts more of a
      backpacker, surfy crowd. Being a small sea side town on the coast of the
      Alentejo, in western Portugal it has some lovely sandy beaches and picture
      perfect traditional architecture, making it a small but loved destination
      for visitors.  The town has some charming traditional buildings. Among the
      most notable ones are the fountains of Amores and Santa Catarina and the
      small, whitewashed chapel of Nossa Senhora do Mar.  The beach is about 500
      meters from the town of Almograve. It is a shallow but extensive beach,
      with low tide providing authentic natural pools.

    description: ' Starting in Aljezur, an attractive village that straddles a river, its western part is Moorish, with a collection of cottages below a ruined 10th century hilltop castle.  Vestiges of the old harbour can be seen in the narrow alleys that give access to the Ribeira de Aljezur.  The 40km of coastline around Aljezur offers some of the most pristine and scenic beaches in Europe with the whole area of river estuaries, sheer cliffs and dense marshes rich in bird and animal life.  As the Algarve turns into Alentejo, the last coastal settlement is Odeceixe, an endearing small town with a beach classified as one of the 7 Wonders. The beach of Odeceixe that has the particularity of containing a river beach.  The beach presents a high quality landscape and biodiversity, being able to enjoy a landscape of rare and enormous beauty of the top of the cliffs. It is in fact in this Natural Park, the only place in the world where you can observe the storks that nest on the cliffs.'

      Leaving Aljezur to enter the surf-central Carrapateira, a tranquil
      village, with two nearby beaches whose lack of development, fizzing surf
      and strong swells attract both both surfers and the people of Lisbon. The
      coast along here is wild, with copper-coloured and ash-grey cliffs with
      also wide sand dunes.  Its landmarks include an old fort and a church. 
      Carrapateira point, or Pontal, was a traditional danger for sailing ships,
      its high reddish rock formations look deceptively similar to Cape St.
      Vincent, the southwest corner of Portugal's coast some eleven miles
      further south.  The extremely fast southbound current and the jutting
      headland that made it a dangerous lure for shipwrecks in the past also
      creates the conditions which have made it a popular surfing destination in
      recent years.

      A region of dramatic natural scenery, comprising of raging seas, towering
      cliffs and vast beaches, you are now cycling in Sagres.  There is little
      of historical or architectural interest as the original town bore the full
      brunt of the 1755 earthquake.  Surfing is the main activity of Sagres but
      there also challenging hiking trails, quiet roads for cycling, while
      departing from the harbour are deep sea fishing trips.  The unique
      Fortaleza de Sagres, this fort has only one defensive wall on the southern
      edge, as the other three are guarded by the immense and sheer cliffs of
      the headland.  Situated within a few Km of Europe's most south western
      point, there’s Cape St. Vincent, up until the 14th century it was believed
      to be the end of the known world. The ferocious waves of the Atlantic
      Ocean pound the massive cliffs, while high above the immensely bright
      light house guards the same dangerous cliffs.  The charm of whitewashed
      houses scattered down the slopes of a hill crowned by the looming bulk of
      a church tower, is found in Vila do Bispo. The narrow streets which
      surround the main church contain many houses typical of the old Algarve,
      with whitewashed walls, bands of bright color, carved stonework around
      doors and windows.

      Lying along the bank of the Rio Bensafrim, with 16th century walls
      enclosing the old town, we have Lagos.  Lagos is a historic and lively
      city that offers visitors glorious beaches, nightlife and a charming
      historic center.  Within the Lagos region is an abundance of varied sights
      and activities, which makes the city a fantastic destination.  Extending
      to the east of Lagos is the 4km long Meia Praia Beach, which is the
      longest sandy beach on the western side of the Algarve.  Aside from its
      hedonistic appeal, Lagos has historical clout, having launched many naval
      excursions during Portugal’s extraordinary Age of Discoveries.  Located
      about halfway between Lagos and Sagres there’s a picturesque fishing
      village, the little village of Salema. Is a paradise to those who are
      seeking tranquility and an escape from the crowd where biking
      opportunities abound.  The village is home to a number of fishermen who
      still cast their nets daily and moor their fishing boats on the shore. 
      Salema's beach is one of the most pleasant and authentic segments of coast
      in Portugal. The stretch immediately in front of town has beach umbrellas
      and services in the European style, and while the coastline to the west is
      fairly rocky, the sandy beachline continues for more than a kilometer to
      the east.  Finishing off this ride, blessed with both a beautiful beach
      and glorious climate, the Luz beach has a welcoming and friendly
      atmosphere, as the town has a significant permanent community of retired
      or emigrated expats.  The beach has soft golden sands and calm, pristine
      clean waters. You’ll surely enjoy having the last stop of this fulfilling
      trip, in this amazingly, beautiful beach with lots of sights that provide
      a lovely and relaxing place to rest.

# Vicentine Cost and Algarve Bike Tour

## From Lisbon or Sines to the south of Portugal thru the coast line

\
\
An amazing biketour through one of Europe's most preserved regions, the southeast Alentejano Natural Park, which includes wild beaches surrounded by imposing cliffs, small mountain ranges, cork oak groves, traditional fishing villages, typical villages, spectacular views and important geographical points, such as Cape Sardão, the Cape of São Vicente (from where the caravels left for seas never before navigated) and Ponta de Sagres.

January to June or October to December is our recomendation to do this bike tour. It is very hot in the summer season, so notice that, if you decid to cycle in July, August or September.

Average temperatures in the Algarve, in the south of Portugal, are usually around 17ºC, and the weather is always sunny or partially sunny, as it is rare to rain in the southern regions, even during the winter.
