Sightseeing, exploration and shopping in the historic center of Porto was always
sought and with a huge satisfaction. In addition to knowing our history, there are
certain places and unforgettable sites in this Northern city, such as the well-known
Market do Bolhao, a place par excellence of typical gastronomic products; The Pérola
do Bolhao, near the market, where you can purchase the famous ornamented canned
products and spices; the famous Café Majestic, a bohemian establishment for coffee
connoisseurs and Art Nouveau; the famous bookstore that inspired J.K. Rowling, author
of Harry Potter, and many establishments dedicated to the Portuguese handcraft and
the port wine. Come and walk with us in the most famous shopping streets and the
city where the story, in parallel, joins the crafts, wine, gastronomy and its landscapes
over the river Douro. During this walking tour, you can purchase products and unique
and unmatched parts of the city, serving often as a souvenir to family and friends.
