      This amazing cycling trip starts in Melgaço, a city in the north of
      Portugal, on the banks of the Minho River.  It is a small town, very
      beautiful and historic, overseen by the tower of Homage, located high up
      in the old medieval town. It overviews the beautiful Minho valley, filled
      with vineyards, that surrounds Melgaço and the nearby Peneda Geres park.
      Included is an introductory meeting with our local partner including tour
      presentation and explanation.

      Your route follows several bicycle paths along the Minho River, always
      with Spain on the other side. The Minho River Valley is famous for its
      beautiful landscapes, history, gastronomy, and the well-known, and much
      appreciated green wine, Alvarinho.  The sloping valleys here are conducive
      to the practice of agriculture and viticulture. Several archaeological
      sites testify to the passage of different people and cultures through
      these lands. Your destination today is Valença, a historic town in the
      north of Portugal, located on the border with Spain and separated by the
      beautiful Minho River. The village sits on a hilltop and is surrounded by
      ramparts. During the Middle Ages, Valença’s hilltop position and
      privileged view over the River Minho were vital to protecting Portugal
      from invasion by its northern neighbors.

      Leaving Valença, but continuing along the Minho River that marks the
      border with Spain, today's destination is Caminha, a fortified border town
      where several battles were fought between Portugal and Spain. Standing on
      a tiny island in the middle of the estuary are the ruins of the fort of
      Ínsua, built as a defensive measure during the 15th century. Nowadays
      there is a daily ferry linking the two banks of the river between the
      countries. This city is also very well-known for its natural and green
      heritage, waterfalls, beaches, camping parks, and Modelo beach. During the
      day, you will pass through Vila Nova de Cerveira, the 'Village of the
      Arts'. Since 1978, Vila Nova de Cerveira has been famous for its biennial
      exhibition of visual arts, a prestigious national event whose fame has now
      spread to other countries and has begun to attract many international
      artists.

      Along the coast, you cycle overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, passing through
      Vila Praia de Âncora. Located at the end of the Âncora river, this
      beautiful little city is nested in a valley protected from the winds by
      the Serra d'Arga hills on the north and the Monte de Santa Luzia in the
      south. With its enchanting landscapes, magnificent views from the Mount of
      Calvary, and excellent regional gastronomy, this village will surely amaze
      you. Today's destination is Viana do Castelo. One of the most beautiful
      seaside cities in the north of Portugal. Viana was critical to Portugal in
      the Age of the Discoveries. This city has a deep connection with the sea
      showcased during the great festivity of “Nossa Senhora da Agonia”. It was
      also here that the ships were built and later deployed to Brazil, India,
      Africa, and other Portuguese colonies (14th and 15th centuries).

      Leaving Viana, today the cycling will lead inland, with the beautiful Lima
      River as your companion. The destination is Ponte de Lima, one of the most
      charming towns of northern Portugal. It is also one of the oldest, with a
      charter from 1125. Its bridge over the Lima River, built by the Romans in
      the first century, has always been a place of passage for the pilgrims who
      are going to Santiago.

      a mountainous municipality with the Lima River flowing along the left
      bank, and half its territory extending into the Peneda-Gerês National
      Park. It earned the title of Natural Reserve of the Biosphere.
      Archaeological findings have proved that it was already inhabited since
      prehistoric times. The bridge is one of the most important medieval
      bridges in Portugal, dating back to the first half of the 15th century.
