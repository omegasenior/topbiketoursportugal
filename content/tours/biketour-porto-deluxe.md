Ride to the beaches of northern Portugal has never been so pleasant to the taste
  of the idyllic and fantastic scenery. Experience the unmatched Portuguese northern
  coast, where you can find various cities dedicated to the activity and fishing industry,
  where the fish gastronomy, such as, cod fish, sardines, sea bass and dourada rules.
  In the middle of this bicycle route, find buildings of public interest, considered
  as an historical heritage of the city, such as the Porto Custom House, (a place
  for local events and exhibitions); the unavoidable tidal pools, designed by Álvaro
  Siza Vieira, (very attended in summer); a replica of a ship of the Portuguese Discoveries,
  of the sixteenth century, ending in Póvoa do Varzim, with its famous sea inlets.
