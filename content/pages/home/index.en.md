    ## Climate and Geography


    “The sun is out 300 days per year with few raining days” and it is perfect
    for cycling. Portugal coastline as nearly 1800 km, including the Madeira and
    Azores islands. 


    In general Portugal offers warm and sunny summers, mild winters, and autumn
    and spring are normally warm however with some wind and rainfall.


    The winter in Portugal generally starts in late November and lasts till
    February. March, April and October are normally very mild and the summer
    period is a nice long period from May to September.


    The summers in the North are pleasant and hot without becoming sweltering
    hot. The winter in **Porto** and inland are colder than the rest of
    Portugal, but the climate is still mid if compare with the rest of Europe.
    It can snow but is rare. It is easy to find snow in Serra da Estrela in the
    winter.

    In Lisbon and **Central Portugal** temperatures can go to 30 degrees easily

    The important rivers in Portugal are **Mondego**, **Douro**, **Minho** And
    **Tejo**. The Mondego begins in Serra da Estrela where is the highest
    mountain in Portugal. This river crosses Coimbra (the third big city in the
    country after Lisbon and Porto), and ends in the sea at Figueira da Foz.
    Douro and Minho both rise in Spain and flow into the Atlantic. Tejo also
    rise in Spain is the main river and meets the Atlantic in Lisbon.


    The **North of Portugal** is mountainous and hilly and it is easy to find
    small farms and vineyards. North is cooler that the south and also have more
    rain. Although the mountain’s our bike tour in the North is almost flat due
    the fact that follows the banks Minho and Lima river. 


    In the South of Portugal, after **Lisbon** and the Tejo River, is the
    **southern of Portugal** also known as the **Alentejo**. Here the climate is
    drier and warmer than the North, and the landscape is dominated by plains
    and smooth hills. The Alentejo Coastline is a very wild region with stunning
    beaches and striking untouched nature. 


    More to the south is the **Algarve** region that is very popular because it
    is a tourist destination. This region is very dry and sunny and you can find
    here amazing beaches.


    The [Vicentine Coast and Algarve bike tour
    ](https://topbiketoursportugal.com/south-portugal-biketour)is a great
    journey for those who seek for beach and wild scenery.


    In Central and Northern Portugal, the coastline as also many white sandy
    beaches, and in the summertime, especially in August, are full of people.
