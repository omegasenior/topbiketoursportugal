      Marta was born in 1996: "Since I was a little girl, my biggest dream has
      ever been to become a tourist guide, because I love to discover new people
      and new ways of thinking. I went to the university to study tourism and,
      in the end of all of it, this job opportunity appeared in my way. During a
      whole month period, my colleagues prepared me to become an expert in this
      field, being supportive all along the way. Finally I had my first tour. It
      wasn’t long after that I also had my first review. That was, in itself,
      the best payment anyone could ever have had, because in this way i touched
      the heart of the people by showing them the amazing culture my city has to
      offer. I am a sports girl, i practiced badminton, karate, swimming and the
      bicycle was my transportation for everywere. I speak English and Spanish,
      and my joy is to take my time to make your vacations worthwhile and
      memorable."
