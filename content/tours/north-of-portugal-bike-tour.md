      This amazing cycling trip starts in Melgaço, a city in the north of
      Portugal, on the banks of the Minho River.  It is a small town, very
      beautiful and historic, overseen by the tower of Homage, located high up
      in the old medieval town. It overviews the beautiful Minho valley, filled
      with vineyards, that surrounds Melgaço and the nearby Peneda Geres park.
      Included is an introductory meeting with our local partner including tour
      presentation and explanation.

    description: >-
      Your route follows several bicycle paths along the Minho River, always
      with Spain on the other side. The Minho River Valley is famous for its
      beautiful landscapes, history, gastronomy, and the well-known, and much
      appreciated green wine, Alvarinho.  The sloping valleys here are conducive
      to the practice of agriculture and viticulture. Several archaeological
      sites testify to the passage of different people and cultures through
      these lands. Your destination today is Valença, a historic town in the
      north of Portugal, located on the border with Spain and separated by the
      beautiful Minho River. The village sits on a hilltop and is surrounded by
      ramparts. During the Middle Ages, Valença’s hilltop position and
      privileged view over the River Minho were vital to protecting Portugal
      from invasion by its northern neighbors.

      Day 2: Melgaço – Valença, 27 mi. (43 km) plus extra track to Tui, 4 mi. (6

  - day: '3'
    description: >-
      Leaving Valença but continuing along with the Minho river that marks the
      border with Spain, one of the destinations today is Caminha, a fortified
      border town where several battles were fought between Portugal and Spain.
      Standing on a tiny island in the middle of the estuary are the ruins of
      the fort of Ínsua, built as a defensive measure concerning the entrance in
      the river during the XVth century. Nowadays there is a daily ferry-boat
      linking the two banks of the river between the countries. This city is
      also very well-known for its natural and green heritage: the sightseeing
      areas, waterfalls, beaches, camping parks and the Modelo beach (a favorite
      destination of famous people in Portugal). The middle stop of this day is
      Vila Nova de Cerveira, the 'Village of the Arts'. An internationally
      recognized 'cognomen', resulting from the pioneering of the
      “InternationalArt Biennials”, which began in 1978. The city then became
      the meeting point of artists from all over the world.   Today's
      destination is Viana do Castelo. One of the most beautiful seaside cities
      in the north of Portugal. Viana was critical to Portugal in the Age of the
      Discoveries.  This city has a deep connection with the sea showcased
      during the great festivity of “Nossa Senhora da Agonia”. It was also here
      that the ships were built and later deployed to Brazil, India, Africa, and
      other Portuguese colonies (14th and 15th centuries).

      Leaving Viana, today the cycling will lead inland, with the beautiful Lima
      River as your companion. The destination is Ponte de Lima, one of the most
      charming towns of northern Portugal. It is also one of the oldest, with a
      charter from 1125. Its bridge over the Lima River, built by the Romans in
      the first century, has always been a place of passage for the pilgrims who
      are going to Santiago.

    description: >-
      Today is the day to know the south bank of the river Lima for about 25 km
      and then you will begin your journey heading to Esposende, a seaside city
      located in the North. During the first day, you will be overwhelmed with
      seaside landscapes and small“Portuguese rivieras” until you reach
      Esposende, a city from the Middle Ages. Neiva river and its clear waters,
      green pine forest of Ofir and the stunning views that offer different
      viewpoints about Esposende, are just some of the interesting features of
      the county in which the richness of the natural landscape and heritage
      built by human hand as is the case of windmills, fields in the trough, the
      forts, and mills, are combined in a unique harmony, forming landscapes of
      high scenic and environmental value and confirms Esposende as one of the
      most beautiful counties in the North region.

      During this last day, you will be overwhelmed with seaside landscapes and
      small “Portuguese rivieras” until you reach Porto. During your last day, a
      huge variety of fishing villages (Póvoa de Varzim) will be met by us,
      where we can experience ancient traditions linked to the fish exploration
      as well taste this famous gastronomy. In Vila do Conde, you’ll know why
      these Portuguese coastal cities were so important during the “el dorado”
      of the Portuguese Discoveries.
