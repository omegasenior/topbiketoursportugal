It's imperative to refer the second largest Portuguese metropolis without mentioning
the ancient history of Port Wine and its traditional cuisine. The tourist will find
this food tour an astonishing experience, where the Portuguese food and wine takes
an important role, along with the incredible view of the River Douro. The other
side of the water front provides a full city tour, witnessing the famous wine cellars
(from the 18th Century), the link between Porto and its river, iconic iron bridges,
ending with an exclusive tour to the wine cellars.
