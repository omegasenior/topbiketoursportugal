      This amazing cycling trip starts alongside the Atlantic Ocean in Figueira
      da Foz, a city in the center of Portugal, located in the district of
      Coimbra. Here you can enjoy one of the best beaches in Portugal since this
      city is known as the "Queen of the beaches of Portugal", the gastronomy
      and the warm climate. The city is an important industrial center,
      producing wood pulp, paper and glass and it also has notable naval
      construction and fish industries.Here we have a cycling stop in Pedrogão,
      this is a little village that has 1400m of beach. The people of this place
      have always been dedicated to agriculture and fishing, so today Xávega
      Art, a brand image, still persists. Now cycling through São Pedro de Moel,
      surrounded by extensive areas of pine forests, offers various points of
      leisure and communion with nature. A particular note is the famous "Volta
      dos Sete": a course of approximately 7 km, which combines sea, woods and
      beach, with pure forest, parks, fountains and streams. The typical dishes
      that stand out are the: “Vidreiro” soup, Cod soup and Rabbit stew.

      Continuing our cycling ride to Nazaré a beautiful and quiet seaside town,
      with a breathtaking view from the top of a big cliff, where you can climb
      by funicular lift or car.Nowadays, the great attraction of this city is
      the waves and the surf, thanks to the "Cannon of Nazaré", a submarine
      geomorphological phenomenon that allows the formation of giant and perfect
      waves. It is the largest submerged gorge in Europe, with about 170
      kilometres along the coast, which is 5000 meters deep.The Hawaiian surfer
      Garrett McNamara gave it worldwide visibility when, in 2011, he surfed the
      world's biggest wave.The middle stop of this day is the Beach of the North
      and that part of Nazaré region and here you will find the biggest waves in
      Europe.

      Leaving Nazaré the next village is Óbidos. Without doubt this town is one
      of Portugal's most classic walled settlements and the visitors can also
      enjoy amazing views of windmills, vineyards and surrounding farmlands. In
      the residential area below, narrow cobblestone streets are lined with
      whitewashed houses supporting terracotta roofs. Every year the city
      organizes two important events, the first one is  a traditional 'Medieval
      Market', where the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of
      medieval Europe and the second one is the Chocolate Festival is also an
      event that attracts great interest from tourists, in this festival you can
      see real-life chocolate sculptures.  São Martinho do Porto is the city of
      passage today. This region constituted by the Serra da Pescaria and by the
      Bouro mountain constituted, in geological times, a single island. When it
      was divided it gave rise to the bay of São Martinho do Porto. São Martinho
      do Porto was even considered the best beach to go with the family in the
      guide of 2015 beaches of eDreams.

      On this fifth day we will return to the coastal area to the city of
      Peniche. The city was built on a rocky peninsula which is considered by
      geologists, a unique example of the Toarcian turnover during the worldwide
      Early Jurassic extinction.Peniche is known for its long beaches, which are
      popular for recreational activities and sports such as surfing,
      windsurfing, body boarding and kite surfing. These beaches are
      consistently windy and have good surf breaks with supertubos and it´s
      considered among the best in Europe.The Berlengas islands, about 10
      kilometres (6 mi) offshore from the peninsula, are part of the
      municipality. They form one of the world's first nature reserves.In this
      day we have a cycling stop in “ Lagoa de Óbidos”, is a lagoon that extends
      between the municipalities of Óbidos and Caldas da Rainha. It is a natural
      barrier that separate the Atlantic Ocean and marine biome from the river
      ecosystem of Foz do Arelho formed by lateral dunes.

      Leaving Peniche but continuing along the coast the next destination is
      Ericeira, a civil parish and seaside resort/fishing community on the
      western coast of Portugal, in the municipality of Mafra, about 35
      kilometres (22 mi) northwest of the capital, Lisbon.Ericeira was a popular
      summer retreat for many of Lisbon's families in the 1940s and 1950s.
      Today, it is a popular destination for local and visiting tourists, as
      well as surfers from around the world (owing to the forty beaches with
      good conditions in the area)Ericeira is also keen on its musical culture.

      existed since 1849 and pursues a path of success in this villages's
      musical heritage with a permanent free musical school for all who love
      this type of culture.The beach of Santa Cruz it´s the place of passage
      during this day, and it is a place that is conducive to a large part of
      wave sports. Every year there is the "Ocean Spirit" festival of wave
      sports where international competitions of various kinds are held.
