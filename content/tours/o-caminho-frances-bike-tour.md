      Day 4 – Caminha – Baiona: During our fourth cycling day, we’re going to
      enter in Spanish territory, ending in Bayona.  It’s a city politically
      linked to Pontevedra where you can breathe the sea breeze. Yet, apart from
      the sea landscape you can also get lost in the old city centre, born from
      Roman roots and grew always towards the coast during the Middle Ages, with
      an influence from the Catholic Church. Curiously, during the XVI Century,
      Bayona was raided by British ships led by the great corsair and explorer
      Francis Drake who saw an opportunity to establish a commercial and
      merchant point in this territory.

      Vigo and will end in San Simon’s bay with a watery landscape to feast our
      eyes.  Always following the coast line, this day will be dedicated to
      Arcade and its famous oysters. Apart from this delightful cuisine, you
      will see monuments and sights dedicated to the Santiago’s culture, such as
      the church of Santiago in Arcade (XII-XIII centuries) and roads or paths
      that will lead to our pilgrimage destination.  It’s almost mandatory that
      if you are passing by Arcade, you must taste and enjoy the famous oysters,
      produced and harvested in the waters of this region. Curiously, during
      April’s first week there’s a festival dedicated to this traditional
      gastronomy – “Fiesta de la Ostra” – where the city is filled with tourists
      and pilgrims to attend this event.

      Day 6 – Pontevedra – Caldas de Reis  Heading to a pre-Roman city, Caldas
      de Reis, a province which belongs to Pontevedra.  According to historical
      archives, the first inhabitants were a pre-Roman community that lived from
      the hot springs of this territory. The name “Caldas de Reis” is connected
      to the birthplace of Afonso VII, acting in the Middle Ages as a pilgrim
      path to Santiago de Compostela. Apart form the rich cultural heritage,
      like Arcade, Caldas de Reis holds a peculiar gastronomy, such as the
      “empanadas” of lamprey and the traditional Spanish bread. Since the hot
      springs accompanied the evolution of this territory, nowadays is a hot
      spot for tourism who seek better healthy treatments for several illnesses.
