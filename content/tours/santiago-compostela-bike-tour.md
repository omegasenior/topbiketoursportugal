      Porto: Before starting this cycling journey towards Santiago de
      Compostela, it’s almost obligatory to present and know Porto, classified
      as World Heritage and Capital of Culture and Tourism. Join us in a city
      tour (bike or walk) in the City Centre and discover a huge miscellanea of
      heritage, from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 20th Century. Meet
      famous and well-known hot spots, such as the bookstore that influenced
      J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, the magnificent Stock Exchange Marke, blue
      and white tiled churches and much more. Art, heritage and traditions are
      meant to be found and seen during this short city tour.

      From our store, based in the “Invicta” city of Porto, we will begin our
      journey heading to Esposende, a seaside city located to the North. During
      this second day, you will be overwhelmed with seaside landscapes and small
      “Portuguese rivieras”, until you reach Esposende, a city from the Middle
      Ages. A huge variety of fishing villages (Póvoa de Varzim) will be met by
      us, where we can experience ancient traditions linked to the fish
      exploration, as well as taste this famous gastronomy. In Vila do Conde,
      you’ll know why these Portuguese coastal cities were so important during
      the “el dorado” of the Portuguese Discoveries

      We’re reaching Viana do Castelo, another sea docking city that was quite
      important during the Discoveries’ period. During the XIV-XVth Centuries it
      was in this precise city that the ships going to Brazil, India, Africa and
      other Portuguese Colonies were developed. Our final destination will be
      Caminha. This city finds the shore of the river Minho, making it part of
      an incredible landscape. Caminha is also very well-known for its natural
      and green heritage, like the sightseeing areas, waterfalls, beaches and
      the camping park.

      During our fourth cycling day, you are going to enter in Spanish
      territory, ending in Bayona. It’s a city politically linked to Pontevedra
      where you can breathe the sea breeze. Away from the sea landscape you can
      also get lost in the old city center. Born from the Romans, the city kept
      growing towards the coast during the Middle Ages, with an influence from
      the Catholic Church. Curiously, during the XVI Century, Bayona was raided
      by British ships, led by the great corsair and explorer Francis Drake who
      saw an opportunity to establish a commercial and merchant point in this
      territory.

      The fifth day will encompass the stream of Vigo and will end in San
      Simon’s bay with a watery landscape to feast our eyes. Always following
      the coastline, this day will be dedicated to Arcade and its famous
      oysters. Apart from this delightful cuisine, you will see monuments and
      sights dedicated to Santiago’s culture, such as the church of Santiago in
      Arcade (XII-XIII centuries) and roads and paths that will lead to our
      pilgrimage destination. It’s almost mandatory that, if you are passing by
      Arcade, you must taste and enjoy the famous oysters produced and harvested
      in the waters of this region. Curiously, during April’s first week there
      is a festival dedicated to this traditional gastronomy – “Fiesta de la
      Ostra” – where the city is filled with tourists and pilgrims to attend
      this event.

      Heading to a pre-Roman city, Caldas de Reis, a province which belongs to
      Pontevedra. According to historical archives, the first inhabitants were a
      pre-Roman community that lived from the hot springs of this territory. The
      name “Caldas de Reis” is connected to the birthplace of Afonso VII, acting
      in the Middle Ages as a pilgrim path to Santiago de Compostela. Apart from
      the rich cultural heritage, like Arcade, Caldas de Reis holds a peculiar
      gastronomy, such as the “empanadas” of lamprey and the traditional Spanish
      bread. Since the hot springs accompanied the evolution of this territory,
      nowadays it is a hot spot for tourism who seek better healthy treatments
      for several illnesses

      Your last day will be met by Santiago de Compostela as your final
      destination, one of the ultimate pilgrimage cores in Western Europe. Like
      Rome and Jerusalem, the city of Santiago de Compostela presents us an
      unique religious beacon for tourists who find in this cycling journey an
      act of faith and inner-self. Reach the Square of Obradoiro, where you will
      witness the majestic baroque cathedral where the remains of the apostle
      are located.
