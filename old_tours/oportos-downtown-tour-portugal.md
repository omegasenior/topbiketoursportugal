Hop on a bicycle and explore Porto's historic centre with us. You will encounter
an urban city towards Art and Architecture, from the Middle Ages to the Modern Era.
It has never been so easy and fun to discover Porto by bike, so don't miss the opportunity
and visit us. Bring your own camera to record everything. We will stop in a few
important sites, very appreciated and visited by those who love sightseeing and
breathtaking canvas, where the Douro River perfectly combines with its squares,
monuments and urban canopy. This tour was developed especially for those who cannot
abandon a bicycle and really want to take a different and unique tour throughout
Oportoâ€™s downtown.
